## Why this is an important project?
In a Big Data context, which we live in, there are many data to manipulate, but not much knowledge. With this project I tried to show my my skills on all steps of the ETL Process. It starts manipulating data from csv files, changing data types, removing duplicated values and ends saving all into a SQL database.
As an engineer student, I saw the oportunity to use data science in a traffic context. The porpuse of this project is to reflect about a few assumptions every one that uses public or private transportation wonder: Does cars on the left lane run faster? Does heavy vehicles alwyas stay on right lanes? How can we predict the speed of new cars? Those questions were answered using data science skills.
